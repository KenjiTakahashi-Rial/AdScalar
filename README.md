I used bootstrap and react-bootstrap to display the table, so please install those before running the app.

    $ npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

To run the app just start the server.

    $ npm start

The base http://localhost:[port] and http://localhost:[port]/index should both display the app.

I was a little confused on the wording of section [2] of the assignment.

    "If the most recent profit margin was > 0, do not decrease the budget"

Was this meant to be "< 0"? In either case, I just adjusted the budget when the profit margin was negative or positive, I hope that is okay!
